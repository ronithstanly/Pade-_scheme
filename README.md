# Pade_scheme
Third-order Pade' Scheme.

Matrix taken from Eq. 2.18,Page 21, 'Fundamentals of Engineering Numerical Analysis' by Parviz Moin.

Inverts the Matrix and finds x (of Ax=B) using Gauss Elimintaion (Code from Rosetta: https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination#Fortran)

Tested the code succesfully with gfortran compiler (Please note that ifortran gave different results).

Thanks to Dr.Sainath Chamarthi for the guidance!
